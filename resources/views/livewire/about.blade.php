    <p class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mt-3">Purpose of the Application </p>
    <p class="mt-8">The application's goal is to show off Laravel Livewire's development capabilities for a straightforward Single Page Application (SPA). It attempts to demonstrate how Livewire may be used to dynamically render various pages or components without requiring a full page reload, making the user experience more seamless and engaging. The Home, About, and Contact pages/components will be the three primary sections of the application.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Homepage:</b> The user will be welcomed and given a brief overview of the SPA on this page.</p>

<p><b>About Page:</b> To give the user context, the About page will include details about the application's developer or goal.</p>

<p><b>Contact Page:</b> This page has a straightforward contact form with fields for a user's name, email address, and message. The form will be validated and submitted asynchronously using Livewire, improving user experience by preventing needless page refreshes.</p>
